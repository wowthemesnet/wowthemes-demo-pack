So, how can small businesses stay nimble in the face of these challenges? Here are three can-do items to add to your small-business flexibility list:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>1. <strong>Look for a niche<\/strong>. Small businesses often can spot and react more quickly to market trends. If you don\u2019t already have something in mind, the U.S. Small Business Administration suggests conducting a market survey with current and\/or potential customers to uncover untapped needs. Look for areas that are being ignored by your competitors. Maybe it\u2019s a certain feature in a product or a tool aimed at a small but passionate audience.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2. <strong>Find technology that fits multiple needs<\/strong>. Larger businesses may have receptionists, IT departments and contractors, but for small businesses, implementing technology that has a big-business look and functionality without the cost is a must. For instance, changing the&nbsp;phone system&nbsp;to an easy-to-use AT&amp;T Syn248 Deskset and Gateway system (smbtelephones.att.com\/syn248) can trim expenses because it\u2019s designed for start-ups and small-sized businesses. It involves a quick and simple set-up and is compatible with existing networks. The system is also convenient to manage and has all the functionality busy offices need, such as built-in voicemail, contact storage, do-not-disturb, paging, conferencing and call forwarding. Expandability is a cinch for growing small businesses \u2014 just add phones as needed.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. <strong>Cultivate communication within<\/strong>. You can often find the best strategies by asking around the office. Talk to your employees daily about their ideas for growth and hopes for the future. Keeping that channel of communication alive will help you identify inefficiencies and new opportunities. This way, you\u2019re not only finding ways to increase production and profitability, you\u2019re also making your employees feel more invested in your small business.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":0,"post_date":"2020-10-08 02:15:39","post_date_gmt":"2020-10-08 02:15:39","guid":"http:\/\/www.themepush.com\/demo-mediumish\/?p=165","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"_edit_lock":"1678599857:1","_edit_last":"1","_thumbnail_id":"378","wowpopup_hide_hide-wowpopup-on-this-page":"0","_wp_page_template":"default","_pt_claps":"182","hide_featured_image_hide_featured_image_on_post":"","_wp_old_date":"2017-11-08"},"terms":{"category":[{"term_id":9,"name":"social","slug":"social","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":9,"taxonomy":"category","description":"","parent":0,"count":7,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"post_tag":[{"term_id":19,"name":"intro","slug":"intro","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":19,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":2,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"nav_menu":[],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"wp_theme":[],"wp_template_part_area":[],"download_category":[],"download_tag":[]}},{"type_title":"Posts","post_id":161,"post_title":"10 Steps to Help Older Adults Prevent Slips, Trips and Falls","post_status":"publish","post_name":"10-steps-to-help-older-adults-prevent-slips-trips-and-falls","post_content":"Some of the most serious injuries among older adults, age 65 and older, are caused by falling. More than 1.6 million older Americans end up in the emergency room or hospital because of a fall, according to the National Institutes of Health. Seniors who have broken a hip by falling can have trouble recovering and regaining mobility.\nThe good news is many falls are preventable. One of the first things you can do if you take prescription medication is have your health care team review your medication.\n<blockquote>\u201cSome prescription medicines and over-the-counter drugs, or a combination of them, can make you dizzy or sleepy. Either can lead to a fall,\u201d said&nbsp;Jaza Marina, M.D., a geriatrician at Kaiser Permanente in Atlanta. \u201cIf you fall, be sure to let your doctor know, even if you aren\u2019t hurt. Sometimes falls are a sign of a new medical problem that needs attention.\u201d<\/blockquote>\nMany underlying causes of falls can be treated or corrected. Dr. Marina <strong>recommends these 10 proactive steps<\/strong> to reduce the risk of falling. Make your home safe.\n\n1. Remove clutter, throw rugs and electrical cords that might cause you to trip.\n2. Store items on bottom shelves.\n3. Add grab bars where necessary \u2014 in hallways, stairways and bathtubs.\n4. Add a rubber bath mat in the shower or tub.\n5. Make sure your home is well lit. Use night lights in hallways and bathrooms.\n6. Keep a phone and flashlight by your bed.\nTake care of yourself.\n7. Stay as physically active as you can.\n8. Wear comfortable shoes with good support.\n9. Have your vision and hearing checked.\n10.

Sure, there are traditional gifts. But what modern couple really wants wool or copper for their seventh anniversary? And what would you do with the silver plates traditionally given on a couple\u2019s 23rd?\n<blockquote>Today\u2019s young couples prefer more personalized gifts. For some some unique gift ideas, consider the following list provided by PlaqueMakerPlus.com, maker of customized awards and recognition products:<\/blockquote>\n* Make a video showcasing your life together. Contact friends and families for home videos, then edit them together to show your story as a couple, from childhood to wedding to current day.\n\n* Give the picture frame a modern spin. Framing a nice photo may seem like a no-brainer, but there are ways to make that idea seem more special. For example, PlaqueMakerPlus.com offers a \u201cClear Memories\u201d line of heirloom-quality acrylics, which can be etched with a personalized message, such as part of a poem or the anniversary date, as well as an embedded photograph.\n\nFor an especially enduring gift, consider ordering a laser-engraved photograph plaque. The plaque will last far longer than a photograph in a frame and will become a cherished family mantelpiece and heirloom. At PlaqueMakerPlus.com, you can easily personalize and design your custom gifts online.\n\n* Choose gifts that can be used. Gifts that are both functional and decorative are sure to be hits. For example, wooden bookends carved with names and dates will remind you of your anniversary while also neatening your shelves. Wood is a traditional gift for fifth and sixth-year anniversaries. You might also want to consider pen holders or paperweights.\n\n* Choose something heartfelt. Not all gifts have to be high-tech or expensive. For example, you could write down 365 things that you love about your partner on individual pieces of paper, then put the notes in a nice vase, so your partner can read a loving message from you every day until you\u2019re next anniversary.","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":0,"post_date":"2020-10-07 22:49:51","post_date_gmt":"2020-10-07 22:49:51","guid":"http:\/\/www.themepush.com\/demo-mediumish\/?p=75","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"_edit_lock":"1617120979:1","_edit_last":"1","_thumbnail_id":"79","wowpopup_hide_hide-wowpopup-on-this-page":"0","_pt_claps":"69","_wp_page_template":"default","_wp_old_date":"2017-11-07","hide_featured_image_hide_featured_image_on_post":""},"terms":{"category":[{"term_id":4,"name":"marketing","slug":"marketing","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":4,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Optional description for this category","parent":0,"count":9,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"post_tag":[],"nav_menu":[],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"wp_theme":[],"wp_template_part_area":[],"download_category":[],"download_tag":[]}},{"type_title":"Posts","post_id":65,"post_title":"5 Ways to Cut Down on Stress During a Home Remodel","post_status":"publish","post_name":"5-ways-to-cut-down-on-stress-during-a-home-remodel","post_content":"Maybe you\u2019ve grown just sick enough of that 1970s avocado-green kitchen to update it to something more sleek and modern. Or perhaps it\u2019s as simple as remodeling a bathroom. Whatever the room, home renovations can test even the most patient personality through the sheer chaos and mess that are inevitable.\r\n<blockquote>To get through your renovation, organizing the clutter is key. The following tips should help you stay on top of the disorder.<\/blockquote>\r\n\u2022 Have files for everything. Paperwork should be kept in one place because it will pile up. Inexpensive file folders that are portable can help you stay structured. Create a file for all receipts, and as you post them to a budget, move them to another file labeled \u201cposted.\u201d Permits and papers from the city or homeowner\u2019s association should be kept together in another folder in order to easily put your fingers on them. Just for fun, make a folder of design ideas and pictures from magazines to keep you inspired.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Cover it up. One word: plastic. No, not credit cards. Use it to cover all heavy furniture that must stay in the room. This will prevent dust and debris from getting into the nooks and crannies and keep the finish on the furniture looking shiny.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Keep a list. Supplies are going to run low, and no matter how good your memory, things are going to fall through the cracks if you don\u2019t write them down. Hanging a clipboard on a nail in the area where you are working will help you to stay on point about people you need to call, or things you need to do or buy for the next day.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Have a place for everything. If you\u2019re doing the remodel yourself, there is going to be a certain amount of upheaval. One thing that will help reduce your stress level is keeping your tools in one place. Create a space such as a table, where all small tools are kept The larger tools can sit on the floor underneath. Also, every time you are finished with a tool, put it back in the appropriate spot.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Contain your stress. If cigarettes or smokeless tobacco helps your stress level, try your best to keep things clean by going outside to smoke or by carrying a portable spittoon. After all, you don\u2019t want a fresh burn mark or stain from a spill to end up on your brand-new floors.","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":0,"post_date":"2020-10-07 22:40:43","post_date_gmt":"2020-10-07 22:40:43","guid":"http:\/\/www.themepush.com\/demo-mediumish\/?p=65","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"_edit_lock":"1628344148:1","_edit_last":"1","_thumbnail_id":"66","wowpopup_hide_hide-wowpopup-on-this-page":"0","_pt_claps":"228","_wp_page_template":"default","_wp_old_date":"2017-11-07"},"terms":{"category":[{"term_id":5,"name":"how to","slug":"how-to","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":5,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Optional description for this category","parent":0,"count":6,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"post_tag":[],"nav_menu":[],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"wp_theme":[],"wp_template_part_area":[],"download_category":[],"download_tag":[]}},{"type_title":"Posts","post_id":62,"post_title":"Avoid Body Drought \u2014 How to Prevent Dehydration","post_status":"publish","post_name":"avoid-body-drought-how-to-prevent-dehydration","post_content":"It\u2019s in every living cell, tissue and organ, and it\u2019s second only to oxygen as the thing we need most to survive\u2014pure, clean water. We can\u2019t live without it, and we can\u2019t live well without enough of it. We are constantly in need of water as we lose water with every breath and every activity of the body. We are especially at risk for dehydration when we exercise or we are ill\u2014this is when dehydration, even mild dehydration, can take its toll, causing you to feel tired and drained of energy. Anyone may become dehydrated, but young children, older adults and people with chronic illnesses are most at risk.\n\nDr. Julie Scarano, a&nbsp;doctor of chiropractic&nbsp;who is trained in prevention and wellness (in addition to providing care for neuromusculoskeletal conditions such as neck or back pain, for which chiropractors are most well known) believes it\u2019s better to prevent dehydration than to treat it. She also reminds you that the 23 intervertebral discs in your spine have high water content and that dehydration can be associated with spinal pain.\n\nHere are some preventative tips to help avoid dehydration:\n\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Choose your beverages wisely. Avoid or limit fruit juices, sodas, alcohol and high-sugar sports drinks.\n\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Drink a glass of water during and between meals, as well as before, during and after exercise.\n\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Plan outdoor activities for cooler parts of the day.\n\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Eat foods that are high in water content, such as fruits and vegetables.\n\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Make water your go-to beverage of choice.\n\nUnless you are socially inept, the wow-factor is what you\u2019re looking for when you give your holiday gifts.

Well, we\u2019ve all had to smile graciously, while mentally distancing ourselves from someone who\u2019s present screamed, \u201cClueless.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what your \u201cwow\u201d gifts say about you:\n\nWhile some women might be thrilled to receive a huge bottle of expensive perfume, others might interpret such an \u201ceasy\u201d present the same way one New York writer did when her now ex-boyfriend gifted her after she spent weeks hunting down the perfect briefcase for him: \u201cIt just seemed like something he picked up at the airport duty-free store.\u201d Ouch.\n\n<strong>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I understand your passions.<\/strong>&nbsp;While an Italian roadster may be out of the question for most of us, there is a whole social marketing industry that offers gift certificates for \u201cexperiences,\u201d such as a few hours behind the wheel of exotic autos.

One Direction and 5 Seconds of Summer are in.)\n\nOne caveat: If you\u2019re thinking of contributing to a charity in someone else\u2019s name, make sure it\u2019s a cause they believe in as much as you do.

After all, no matter how you slice it, there is a lot of work that goes into getting ready for the season.\r\n\r\nThankfully, for today\u2019s hunter, things have changed drastically from previous decades. It used to be that hunters slept in tents, heated tin cans of beans over an open fire, wore puffy down parkas to keep warm and stayed near paved roads in case they needed help.\r\n\r\nNow, lodges, guides, cooks, cell phones and all-terrain vehicles make hunting a more enjoyable and safer experience.\r\n\r\nThe following tips will help you get prepped for this year\u2019s hunting season:\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u2022 Check your license.<\/strong>\u00a0Ensure that your hunting license is valid and covers all varieties of wildlife you intend to hunt. Even if you\u2019ve hunted in the same location, check that permit requirements haven\u2019t changed. Regulations get updated yearly, so don\u2019t assume that what was valid last year still applies to your favorite watering hole.\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u2022 Pack your bag.<\/strong>\u00a0If you\u2019re planning to travel out of town, you\u2019ll need a hunting permit for that state. If you\u2019re staying local, your bag should be filled with essential items that will help you survive any unexpected situation\u2014be it weather or something else. This includes a cell phone, GPS, first aid kit, lighter, binoculars, small rope, pocket knife, bottled water and a few high-energy snacks.\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u2022 Take the right clothing.<\/strong>\u00a0Depending on where you\u2019re headed, you\u2019ll need a light or heavy jacket, gloves, hat and layers for nights when the temperatures dip. And don\u2019t forget the rain gear. If in a warmer climate, you can dress down with lighter clothes, but whatever the case, don\u2019t forget your orange hunting vest. One caveat: wash any clothes you intend to wear with unscented laundry detergent.

Don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions. If it\u2019s a party, ask the host or hostess questions to get the answers you need. Is the party BYOB? What\u2019s the dress code? Knowing these details allows you to be one step ahead of the game from the moment you arrive.\r\n\r\n<strong>Prepare Yourself<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFeel confident in public knowing that you are as prepared as possible. For smokeless tobacco users, this means investing in the accoutrements you need to do your thing. Check out the sleek portable spittoons made by FLASR, an Atlanta-based company that specializes in these types of trendy accessories.\\\r\n\r\nIt starts when you receive the invitation in the mail\u2014either your computer\u2019s inbox or the one that your junk mail gets delivered to.\r\n\r\nThat complex social problem of being asked to a party.\r\n\r\nDo you bring the host or hostess something? If so, what? Is wine too pretentious? Perhaps craft beer, or is that elitist? And what to wear? Is it a casual gathering or a dinner party where at least a sport coat is needed? Is it acceptable to add a plus-one, since you just started dating the potential man or woman of your dreams?\r\n\r\nWhile modern-day society may no longer follow the dictates of Emily Post\u2019s rules of etiquette, there\u2019s nothing like a fete to throw many of us into an internal tailspin.\r\n\r\nTo help navigate the often frustratingly unclear rules of attending a party\u2014be it cocktail, dinner or a child\u2019s birthday\u2014the following tips can help:\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u2022 Call to RSVP.<\/strong>\u00a0The French may not have a corner on manners, but they do know respondez s\u2019il vous plait, or please reply. This is essential for the host to get an accurate headcount. Not to do so, is considered rude and inconsiderate.\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0\u2022 Decode the dress.<\/strong>\u00a0Is it a formal affair that require tuxes and dresses, or a more casual, anything goes party? If you\u2019re unsure, it\u2019s never inappropriate to ask the hostess.\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0\u2022 Go dateless.<\/strong>\u00a0Unless specifically stated, it is considered impolite to bring an uninvited guest or to ask if you can bring another. If you can bring a date, remember to RSVP for them, or conversely, if you accepted for your guest, and plans change, let the host know that as well.\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0\u2022 Hold your liquor.<\/strong>\u00a0While you may want to imbibe all the free-flowing alcohol, avoid drinking to excess. Nothing is more disrespectful and intolerable than a drunk party guest, particularly at more upscale affairs.\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0\u2022 Take what you need to feel comfortable.<\/strong>\u00a0For some that\u2019s a small bottle of aspirin to ward off a headache, a pair of more comfortable shoes discreetly hidden in the folds of a coat, an embroidered handkerchief rather than bulky tissue, or if you\u2019re a smokeless tobacco user, something other than a spit cup or bottle.","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":0,"post_date":"2020-10-07 21:36:49","post_date_gmt":"2020-10-07 21:36:49","guid":"http:\/\/www.themepush.com\/demo-mediumish\/?p=55","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"_edit_lock":"1617120959:1","_edit_last":"1","_thumbnail_id":"56","wowpopup_hide_hide-wowpopup-on-this-page":"0","_pt_claps":"48","_wp_page_template":"default","_wp_old_date":"2017-11-07"},"terms":{"category":[{"term_id":2,"name":"life","slug":"life","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":2,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Optional description for this category","parent":0,"count":13,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"post_tag":[],"nav_menu":[],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"wp_theme":[],"wp_template_part_area":[],"download_category":[],"download_tag":[]}},{"type_title":"Posts","post_id":51,"post_title":"Accessories That Are Easy, Convenient and Portable","post_status":"publish","post_name":"accessories-that-are-easy-convenient-and-portable","post_content":"Some of your favorite accessories are the ones you reach for again and again, those items that are portable, easy, and convenient.

Dressing well is just the starting point. The following tips will help you to appear truly sophisticated all season long.<\/em>\r\n<h3>Stay two steps ahead<\/h3>\r\nWhether it\u2019s an upcoming client meeting or a weekend fete, sophistication is a mere keystroke away. Plan your day ahead by researching the who, what, when and where for whatever event is on tomorrow\u2019s calendar. Want to really swing for the fences? Go to your appointment or event five minutes early.\r\n<h3>Bring a gift<\/h3>\r\nWhile not required, it\u2019s always appreciated. Nothing says class like someone who arrives with a bottle of wine, a seasonal floral arrangement or even just some homemade baked goods. A small, subtle gift for a host or hostess can go a long way in establishing that sophisticated image you desire.\r\n<h3>Put the pen to work<\/h3>\r\nDust off that box of thank-you cards you stashed in your bottom desk drawer, and get to writing. Emails are nice but are used everyday for everything. A thank-you card is more personal and serves one purpose: to make a person feel appreciated. Take note of the important people in your life who deserve a special shout-out. Add your own penmanship and a postage stamp, and you are bound to earn at least a few sophistication points for being thoughtful.\r\n<h3>Use the Internet<\/h3>\r\nWhether it\u2019s staying up on current events or knowing a few details about your favorite 19th-century artist or author, these little-known facts will give you something to talk about in any social setting, helping you appear more approachable and knowledgeable. Get in the habit of using the World Wide Web to glean fun tidbits and major headlines.","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":0,"post_date":"2020-10-07 20:51:23","post_date_gmt":"2020-10-07 20:51:23","guid":"http:\/\/www.themepush.com\/demo-mediumish\/?p=48","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"_edit_lock":"1617120949:1","_edit_last":"1","_thumbnail_id":"49","wowpopup_hide_hide-wowpopup-on-this-page":"0","_wp_page_template":"default","_pt_claps":"72","_wp_old_date":"2017-11-07"},"terms":{"category":[{"term_id":2,"name":"life","slug":"life","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":2,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Optional description for this category","parent":0,"count":13,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"post_tag":[],"nav_menu":[],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"wp_theme":[],"wp_template_part_area":[],"download_category":[],"download_tag":[]}},{"type_title":"Posts","post_id":44,"post_title":"A Life Half Full: Aging With Optimism","post_status":"publish","post_name":"a-life-half-full-aging-with-optimism","post_content":"As Americans age, one element seems to be key for their mental and physical health: optimism. That\u2019s the finding suggested by a new Humana survey, which asked Americans age 60 and over how they perceive the importance of various wellness traits.\r\n\r\nAlthough the survey uncovered many perspectives, the findings about optimism suggest a possible link between a \u201cglass half full\u201d mentality and mental and physical health:\r\n\r\n* Older Americans who rated themselves as very optimistic about aging tended to be the most active physically, socially and in their communities.\r\n\r\n* They also reported a much lower number of physically unhealthy days per month on average: 2.84 for the most optimistic, compared to 12.55 physically unhealthy days for the least optimistic\r\n\r\n* The most optimistic also felt on average 12 years younger than their actual age (those who are least optimistic felt on average 7 years older than their actual age).\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The survey also asked respondents to rate how they feel about the depiction of people age 60 and over in pop culture: in film, television, commercials and so on. Overwhelmingly, the respondents perceived these media portrayals of their own demographic as inaccurate, rating the accuracy level as, on average, 5 or less on a 10-point scale. Those aging Americans who do feel that media accurately portrays them think about aging more than the average and have a higher level of fear about aging than their peers.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nHumana also recently partnered with The University of Southern California (USC) to take a first-ever look into society\u2019s views of aging in America through the lens of film. The\u00a0USC study\u00a0reveals that characters aged 60 and over are underrepresented in film, and that those characters who do appear face demeaning or ageist references. Key findings from the study include:\r\n\r\n* Just 11 percent of characters evaluated were aged 60 and over; U.S. Census data shows that 18.5 percent of the population is aged 60 and over.\r\n\r\n* Out of 57 films that featured a leading or supporting senior character, 30 featured ageist comments \u2014 that\u2019s more than half of the films. Quotes included characters being called \u201ca relic,\u201d \u201ca frail old woman\u201d and \u201ca senile old man.\u201d\r\n\r\n* Only 29.1 percent of on-screen characters engaged with technology, whereas 84 percent of aging Americans report that they use the internet weekly.\r\n\r\nTaken together, these findings feed into growing evidence that suggest that ageism is a social determinant of health and may negatively impact health outcomes for aging Americans. Societal views and negative media portrayals can cause aging Americans to feel invisible. These negative perceptions may dampen optimistic outlooks and impact physical and emotional health.","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":0,"post_date":"2020-10-07 20:37:31","post_date_gmt":"2020-10-07 20:37:31","guid":"http:\/\/www.themepush.com\/demo-mediumish\/?p=44","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"_edit_lock":"1617120943:1","_edit_last":"1","_thumbnail_id":"45","wowpopup_hide_hide-wowpopup-on-this-page":"0","_pt_claps":"48","_wp_page_template":"default","_wp_old_date":"2017-11-07"},"terms":{"category":[{"term_id":2,"name":"life","slug":"life","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":2,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Optional description for this category","parent":0,"count":13,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"post_tag":[],"nav_menu":[],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"wp_theme":[],"wp_template_part_area":[],"download_category":[],"download_tag":[]}},{"type_title":"Posts","post_id":41,"post_title":"Food, Fuel, and Finance \u2026 The 3Fs of Economics","post_status":"publish","post_name":"food-fuel-and-finance-the-3fs-of-economics","post_content":"Nearly half of U.S. high school students say they do not know how to <a href=\"#\">establish good credit<\/a> and more than one-fourth believe they will be unprepared to manage their finances upon graduation.

By the full moon hanging low in the west he knew what he might not have known otherwise: that it was near the hour of dawn. A light mist lay along the earth, partly veiling the lower features of the landscape, but above it the taller trees showed in well- defined masses against a clear sky.\n\nTwo or three farmhouses were visible through the haze, but in none of them, naturally, was a light.Nowhere, in- deed, was any sign or suggestion of life except the barkingof a distant dog, which, repeated with mechanical iteration, servedrather to accentuate than dispel the loneliness of the scene.\n\n<em>The man looked curiously about him on all sides, as one who amongfamiliar surroundings is unable to determine his exact place and part inthe scheme of things. It is so, perhaps, that we shall act when, risenfrom the dead, we await the call to judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/em>\n\nA hundred yards away was a straight road, show- ing white in themoonlight. Endeavouring to orient himself, as a surveyor or navigatormight say, the man moved his eyes slowly along its visible length and ata distance of a quarter-mile to the south of his station saw, dim andgrey in the haze, a group of horsemen riding to the north. Behind themwere men afoot, marching in column, with dimly gleaming rifles aslantabove their shoulders.\n<blockquote>They moved slowly and in silence. Another groupof horsemen, another regiment of infantry, another and another --all inunceasing motion toward the man's point of view, past it, and beyond. Abattery of artillery followed, the cannoneers riding with folded arms onlimber and caisson. And still the interminable procession came out ofthe obscurity to south and passed into the obscurity to north, withnever a sound of voice, nor hoof, nor wheel.<\/blockquote>\nThe man could not rightly understand: he thought himself deaf; saidso, and heard his own voice, al- though it had an unfamiliar qualitythat almost alarmed him; it disappointed his ear's expectancy in thematter of timbre and resonance. But he was not deaf, and that for themoment sufficed.\n\nThen he remembered that there are natural phe- nomena to which someone has given the name 'acoustic shadows.' If you stand in an acousticshadow there is one direction from which you will hear nothing. At thebattle of Gaines's Mill, <strong>one of the fiercest conflicts of the Civil War<\/strong>, with a hundred guns in play, spectators a mile and a half away on theopposite side of the Chickahominy Valley heard nothing of what theyclearly saw.\n\nThe bombardment of Port Royal, heard and felt at St.Augustine, a hundred and fifty miles to the south, was inaudible twomiles to the north in a still atmosphere. A few days before thesurrender at Ap- pomattox a thunderous engagement between the commandsof Sheridan and Pickett was unknown to the latter commander, a mile inthe rear of his own line.","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":0,"post_date":"2020-10-07 19:10:47","post_date_gmt":"2020-10-07 19:10:47","guid":"http:\/\/www.themepush.com\/demo-mediumish\/?p=10","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"_edit_lock":"1617120927:1","_edit_last":"1","wowpopup_hide_hide-wowpopup-on-this-page":"0","_thumbnail_id":"72","_pt_claps":"128","_wp_page_template":"default","_wp_old_date":"2017-11-07","hide_featured_image_hide_featured_image_on_post":""},"terms":{"category":[{"term_id":2,"name":"life","slug":"life","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":2,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Optional description for this category","parent":0,"count":13,"filter":"raw","meta":[]},{"term_id":8,"name":"technology","slug":"technology","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":8,"taxonomy":"category","description":"You can have an optional description for this category here.","parent":0,"count":4,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"post_tag":[],"nav_menu":[],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"wp_theme":[],"wp_template_part_area":[],"download_category":[],"download_tag":[]}},{"type_title":"Posts","post_id":579,"post_title":"Could we reinvent the charm of old cities?","post_status":"publish","post_name":"could-we-reinvent-the-charm-of-old-cities","post_content":"<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dropCap\":true} -->\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Bucharest's history alternated periods of development and decline from the early settlements in&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Classical_antiquity\">antiquity<\/a>&nbsp;until its consolidation as the national capital of Romania late in the 19th century.

A slip dress is a simple, elegant base layer that can be dressed up with accessories and is a trend worth paying attention to.

If you\u2019re anything like Carrie Bradshaw, the best way to dress up an outfit is with a pair of wedge sandals. The right pair of wedges can glam up your look, make your legs look long, yet still allow you to move comfortably.

With one pair of lenses, your eyes will feel comfortable indoors or out, in bright light, low light and everything in between.\r\n\r\n* <strong>Choose a hat<\/strong>. As important as it is to get some natural vitamin D, too much sun is bad for the skin. A floppy hat is a great accessory that lets you flaunt a style that fits your personality, get a little sun, but still protect yourself from harmful UV rays.\r\n\r\n* <strong>Grab a bag<\/strong>. A statement bag is the perfect way to enhance your look. When choosing the right purse for your outfit, think luxe fabrics, contrasting textures, and bright patterns. Pair with a great pair of glasses to pull off a celebrity look.","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":0,"post_date":"2019-10-08 01:56:20","post_date_gmt":"2019-10-08 01:56:20","guid":"http:\/\/www.themepush.com\/demo-mediumish\/?p=146","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"_edit_lock":"1578766277:1","_edit_last":"1","_thumbnail_id":"155","wowpopup_hide_hide-wowpopup-on-this-page":"0","_pt_claps":"45","_wp_page_template":"default","_wp_old_date":"2017-11-08"},"terms":{"category":[{"term_id":9,"name":"social","slug":"social","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":9,"taxonomy":"category","description":"","parent":0,"count":7,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"post_tag":[],"nav_menu":[],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"wp_theme":[],"wp_template_part_area":[],"download_category":[],"download_tag":[]}},{"type_title":"Posts","post_id":139,"post_title":"Student Backpacks Are Literally a Big Pain","post_status":"publish","post_name":"139-2","post_content":"Beware the overstuffed school backpack!\r\nIf you wonder why more kids than ever before are complaining about back and neck pain \u2014 and you should be, what with classes starting up again \u2014 a likely reason is that they\u2019re weighed down by backpacks crammed with everything from textbooks to laptops to musical instruments.\r\n\r\nConsider this: \u201cThe federal Consumer Product Safety Commission calculated that carrying a 12-pound backpack to and from school and lifting it 10 times a day for an entire school year puts a cumulative load on youngsters\u2019 bodies of 21,600 pounds,\u201d The New York Times reported, \u201cor the equivalent of six mid-sized cars.\u201d\r\n\r\nNo wonder experts warn that kids are putting themselves at risk of even more serious conditions like stress fractures in the back, inflammation of growth cartilage and nerve damage in the neck and shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cOver time, the heavy weight of a backpack can cause an unnatural alignment of the spine as students are forced to offset the pressure by arching the back or bending forward at the hips,\u201d said Sherry McAllister, DC, executive vice president of the not-for-profit\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.f4cp.com\/\">Foundation for Chiropractic Progress<\/a>, adding that students who are already prone to slouching may experience further pain from sitting at a desk for prolonged periods.\r\n\r\nDoctors of chiropractic, who have a minimum seven years of higher learning, specialize in providing drug-free, hands-on care that helps to naturally align and strengthen the spine.

The American Lighting Association (ALA) is on top of the trend to turn a patio, deck or other outdoor area into an additional family room, with all the modern amenities and furnishings.\r\n<blockquote>\u201cPeople want to extend their indoor living space outside, and still have the same quality of finishes outside as inside,\u201d says Rick Seidman, president and CEO of Quoizel, Inc. \u201cThey\u2019re putting rugs, televisions and furniture outside, so we almost have to treat [outside] decorative lighting as if it\u2019s interior.\u201d<\/blockquote>\r\nALA-member lighting manufacturers are making this transition easier with expanded lines of decorative lighting rated for all weather use.\r\n\r\nHinkley Lighting\u2019s CEO, Rick Wiedemer, CLC, explains how the trend of accessorizing outdoor areas with traditionally indoor lighting products has gained momentum over the last several years. \u201c<em>It started with landscape lighting and then moved into sconces, wall sconces, and now pendants and chandeliers<\/em>,\u201d Wiedemer says.\r\n\r\nIn addition to providing brightness, carefully placed lighting can help create a mood or ambiance in a yard, draw attention away from problem spots and highlight special features.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s common to use sconces to highlight doorways and step lights to define spaces. But today\u2019s homeowners are also hanging sophisticated chandeliers and bright pendants over outside tables. Spotlights can be seen above grills and downlights under covered patios.\r\n\r\nJust because the newest outdoor lighting fixtures are beautiful, don\u2019t assume they lack the engineering to withstand severe temperatures and extreme weather. High-quality outdoor fixtures are designed for endurance.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of the things consumers are concerned about when shopping for lighting is durability,\u201d says Seidman. \u201cIt really has to be able to withstand the elements. With new technology, fixture finishes are actually built into the material so that it weathers beautifully.\u201d\r\n\r\nWiedemer concurs. \u201c<strong><em>You want to have something that\u2019s meant to be in the weather<\/em><\/strong>.

It's a lifelong skill that helps you to better understand the world around you and even yourself. And it's becoming increasingly important to ensure that kids don't become non-readers in their busy, over-connected daily lives.\r\n\r\n\"Reading opens up so many possibilities, from discovering a new interest to sparking untapped creativity. Best of all, it is a great way to spend time together as a family,\" says Emily Levitt, vice president of Education for Sylvan Learning.\r\n\r\nHere are a few suggestions to help kids to fall in love with reading, and to share fun, memorable reading experiences together as a family.\r\n\r\n* Read Aloud -- The easiest way to get kids interested in reading and to build their vocabulary is for parents to read aloud to their children, no matter their ages. Kids will often skip over words they don't recognize when reading alone, but if they hear their parents say the word, they may ask for the definition. Putting aside just 15 minutes a week to read aloud to kids can make a difference.\r\n\r\n* Start a Book Club -- Starting a book club with a group of your kid's friends and their parents is a great way to make reading fun. Give participants a month to read the selected book, then organize a party where everyone can chat and enjoy themed snacks.\r\n\r\n* Stick with What They Like -- Kids will be more inclined to read if it's about something they're already interested in. And if you can share that interest with them, that's even better! And because not everyone loves the same subjects or genres, try to at least hook them with engaging books on whatever they enjoy -- be it baseball, magic or anything else.\r\n\r\n* Monkey See, Monkey Do -- It's important that kids see their parents reading. If they don't, it's an unspoken statement to your child that it's okay not to read. From crossword puzzles to comic books, it's easier than you think to build literacy as a family. Make a conscious effort to set time aside time for you and your kids to read together.\r\n\r\n* Deploy Backup -- Not every child is a natural born reader and even kids who are great readers can use reading help.\r\n\r\nSylvan Learning offers reading programs from Pre-K through Grade 12.

Here are a few ways to keep the kids occupied the next time you hit the road.\r\n\r\n* <strong>Books<\/strong> and children\u2019s magazines: Time passes quickly when children are engrossed in a story. Take this opportunity to teach your children the importance of reading. If your kids can\u2019t read in the car, try books on tape or compact discs.\r\n\r\n* <strong>Crafts<\/strong>: Have the kids put together scrapbooks with items from the trip. Pack instant cameras, glue sticks, markers and construction paper to get them started.\r\n\r\n* <strong>Puzzles<\/strong>, board games and cards: At first these activities might seem unfit for road trips, but many newer versions are designed for travel. These games either come in compact cases or with magnetic boards to keep pieces from being lost in the vehicle.\r\n\r\n* <strong>On-screen entertainment<\/strong>: Increasing numbers of consumers are purchasing vehicles with liquid crystal display TV screens for passenger viewing. Today, not only can your kids play video games and watch DVDs in the car, they can catch their favorite television shows as well.\r\n\r\nThe TracVision A5, created by Rhode Island-based KVH Industries, lets you watch live television while on the road.

Some are book authors, some write primarily for magazines, and others are earning a good income by blogging or running destination websites. Tim Leffel, author of \u201cTravel Writing 2.0\u201d (http:\/\/travelwriting2.com), offers these tips on making it as a travel writer, whether in print, e-books, travel apps, or the next media we haven\u2019t seen yet.\r\n\r\n<strong>1.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Get the Basics Down First<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 There is far too much competition in this desirable field for sub-par writers to succeed. Read books on writing well, take a course at your local community college, or attend workshops that include peer and teacher reviews. At a minimum, travel writers need to master the basics of reporting and writing engaging prose before blogging or getting hired by an editor.\r\n\r\n<strong>2.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Find Your Niche<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 Trying to be a generalist travel writer puts you into a bloody pool with incredible competition. It is far easier to make a name for yourself becoming the expert on one region or one style of travel.\r\n\r\n<strong>3.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Be Original<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 Ideas are your main currency as a travel writer. The ability to find good original story ideas for any destination is often more important than what you actually put on the page.\r\n\r\n<strong>4.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Be a Professional<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 The main complaint of editors is that so many writers are unprofessional. They send sloppy e-mails. They miss deadlines. They make promises they can\u2019t deliver. You can rise above the pack by reading publication guidelines carefully and not wasting editors\u2019 time.\r\n<strong>\r\n5.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Travel Every Chance You Get<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 It\u2019s difficult to succeed as a travel writer, even a part-time one, if you are not traveling on a regular basis. It can be in your own region, but you need to go find the stories nobody else is writing and get past the routine vacations that have been reported on a thousand times already.","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":0,"post_date":"2019-10-08 01:13:26","post_date_gmt":"2019-10-08 01:13:26","guid":"http:\/\/www.themepush.com\/demo-mediumish\/?p=121","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"_edit_lock":"1578766307:1","_edit_last":"1","_thumbnail_id":"123","wowpopup_hide_hide-wowpopup-on-this-page":"0","_pt_claps":"52","_wp_page_template":"default","_wp_old_date":"2017-11-08"},"terms":{"category":[{"term_id":7,"name":"creativity","slug":"creativity","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":7,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Optional description for this category","parent":0,"count":6,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"post_tag":[],"nav_menu":[],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"wp_theme":[],"wp_template_part_area":[],"download_category":[],"download_tag":[]}},{"type_title":"Posts","post_id":118,"post_title":"Honoring Moms : How 3 Inspiring Women are Changing the World","post_status":"publish","post_name":"honoring-moms-how-3-inspiring-women-are-changing-the-world","post_content":"<strong>No doubt about it, mothers are the backbone of the family.<\/strong> Theirs is a difficult balance of wife, mother, daughter, and sibling to all the important people in their life.So it stands to reason that while we honor these women on Mother\u2019s Day for all they do, one company is taking it a step further by celebrating these lovely ladies for an entire month.\r\n\r\nDuring the first week of the \"By Moms, For Moms\" promotion, which runs from April 10 through early May, the Seattle-based company will feature clothing collections created by moms who work at zulily.\"As a mother, I\u2019m honored ? with the chance to share our favorite products to hopefully inspire not only customers, but potentially other moms looking for style inspiration from their peers,\" says Kate Aulabaugh, director of merchandising for home.\r\n<blockquote>The second and fourth weeks will include clothing and other products from companies founded by mom entrepreneurs, while the third week features collections curated by mom social-media gurus.In addition to sharing these great product finds, the company is also highlighting these women\u2019s inspirational businesses and personal stories.<\/blockquote>\r\nThey have experienced valuable lessons throughout their entrepreneurial journey, and are sharing what they learned with those who may be looking to follow their own dreams:* Lori, Jodi and Kari of Belly Bandit are revolutionizing today\u2019s shapewear industry with their collection of maternity and post-pregnancy essentials. \"Making mistakes is all part of the process,\" says cofounder Lori Caden. \"There will often be bumps in the road, but if it doesn\u2019t challenge you, it doesn\u2019t change you.\"* Hold Your Haunches was developed by two active moms who couldn\u2019t find a pair of leggings that incorporated shapewear.

One caveat: try to keep it light. If you sound stressed about being late, they\u2019ll be stressed while they\u2019re waiting.\n\n\u2022 You\u2019re a smokeless tobacco user. For smokeless tobacco users, the mere thought of taking a spit cup or bottle on a date is horrific, and of course, an absolute no-no. So, what to do? You might think about investing in a portable spittoon made by FLASR, an Atlanta-based company that specializes in creating smokeless tobacco accessories.\n\nTo avoid the messiness that sometimes goes hand-in-hand with using smokeless tobacco, the FLASR flask has an advanced closing mechanism, ensuring that it stays securely closed when not in use, thus eliminating the risk of spills and leaks often found with cups and bottles. In addition, the small size of the FLSR flask allows users to enjoy smokeless tobacco unobtrusively while in public.","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":0,"post_date":"2019-10-08 00:52:14","post_date_gmt":"2019-10-08 00:52:14","guid":"http:\/\/www.themepush.com\/demo-mediumish\/?p=115","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"_edit_lock":"1578766315:1","_edit_last":"1","_thumbnail_id":"116","wowpopup_hide_hide-wowpopup-on-this-page":"0","_pt_claps":"60","_wp_page_template":"default","_wp_old_date":"2017-11-08","hide_featured_image_hide_featured_image_on_post":""},"terms":{"category":[{"term_id":7,"name":"creativity","slug":"creativity","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":7,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Optional description for this category","parent":0,"count":6,"filter":"raw","meta":[]},{"term_id":4,"name":"marketing","slug":"marketing","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":4,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Optional description for this category","parent":0,"count":9,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"post_tag":[],"nav_menu":[],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"wp_theme":[],"wp_template_part_area":[],"download_category":[],"download_tag":[]}},{"type_title":"Posts","post_id":111,"post_title":"Marketers: Get in touch with your audience","post_status":"publish","post_name":"marketers-get-in-touch-with-your-audience","post_content":"Promotional products are more popular than ever, based on data from a 2016 consumer survey conducted by\u00a0Promotional Products Association International(PPAI).

For example, 79 percent of consumers will pass along a promotional product, whether or not they use it themselves, which extends the brand\u2019s reach.

At home, you sell healthy meals to your kids. When you participate in conference calls or talk to clients, you sell strategies and services.

The hope is that people will place their faith in your opinions and ideas, but this can result in added pressure and stress.

Yes, the economy is poor at the moment, but that doesn\u2019t mean that all business transactions have ground to a halt.

Jan Moran, the creator of the Sephora Fragrance Finder by Scentsa, a touch-screen technology that helps shoppers find and learn about perfume, offers the following tips:\r\n\r\n\u2013 Know your scents. Scents are typically grouped into five categories \u2014 floral, fresh, spicy and warm, woody and earthy, and brisk aromatics. Different scent groups appeal to different personalities.\r\n<blockquote>For example, fresh scents, which include citrus, aquatic and fruit aromas, speak to a sunny personality, while woody and earthy fragrances can seem soothing and calm. Sephora\u2019s Scentsa offers a \u201cDiscover Your Signature Scent Style Quiz,\u201d which can help you determine what scents will best appeal to you.<\/blockquote>\r\n\u201cWith more than 500 new fragrances launched each year, you really have to be educated to find a scent that works for you,\u201d says Moran. \u201cScentsa\u2019s touch-screen application features current information on more than 6,000 fragrances, so it helps customers find confidence when shopping.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2013 Try fragrance wardrobing. Once you know what scents you like, change your perfume for different occasions, moods and climates. Choose rich scents during the winter and lighter fragrances for summer. Relax with vanilla and lavender, energize with rose and tuberose.\r\n\r\n\u2013 Choose a fragrance strength. Perfume is the most intense form of fragrance, followed by eau de parfum, eau de toilette and eau de cologne. Intensity, however, does not mean that the scent will be bold and strong, only that it will last longer on your skin.\r\n\r\n\u2013 Apply fragrance at your pulse points. Your pulse points are behind your ears, at your throat and the nape of the neck, in the decolletage (collar), on your wrists, in the crook of your elbow, behind your knees and on your ankles. Spray fragrance for a more even application.\r\n\r\n\u2013 Store your fragrance correctly. For maximum shelf life, store fragrances in a cool, dry place with the cap tightly secured. Keep fragrances away from direct sunlight.","post_excerpt":"","post_parent":0,"menu_order":0,"post_date":"2019-10-07 23:19:30","post_date_gmt":"2019-10-07 23:19:30","guid":"http:\/\/www.themepush.com\/demo-mediumish\/?p=94","post_mime_type":"","meta":{"_edit_lock":"1578766333:1","_edit_last":"1","_thumbnail_id":"95","wowpopup_hide_hide-wowpopup-on-this-page":"0","_pt_claps":"84","_wp_page_template":"default","_wp_old_date":"2017-11-07"},"terms":{"category":[{"term_id":5,"name":"how to","slug":"how-to","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":5,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Optional description for this category","parent":0,"count":6,"filter":"raw","meta":[]}],"post_tag":[],"nav_menu":[],"link_category":[],"post_format":[],"wp_theme":[],"wp_template_part_area":[],"download_category":[],"download_tag":[]}},{"type_title":"Posts","post_id":86,"post_title":"Do You Know Your Family History?
